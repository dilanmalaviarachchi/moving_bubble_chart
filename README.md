# moving_bubble_chart

A moving bubble chart shows how things change over time. Each bubble stands for something, with its place on the chart showing two different numbers, 
and its size showing a third number. As time goes on, the bubbles move around, showing how these numbers change. 
This chart helps you see patterns and compare different things easily.
